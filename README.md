## About the program

This program searches for specific keywords and notifies you of power outages in your area.
You can run it at startup or at specific intervals using Task scheduler or cron.
If it detects a scheduled power outage it displays all the relevant info in a window.


*The program works fine but it still needs some polishing here and there.*
